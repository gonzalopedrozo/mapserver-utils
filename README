- this package uses the a python script and the c preprocessor to build a
complete mapfile from a set of templates and styling information.

- we rely on the gnu version of sed for post-processing the created mapfile. if
on a BSD platform (e.g. MacOSX) you will need the gsed program which can be installed
e.g. with macports.

- The mapfiles rely on the database schema as created by a recent version of imposm. By default
imposm does not yet create the landusages_gen and waterareas_gen tables. You can either use a version
of imposm that creates these tables (hint: some editing of defaultmapping.py may be required), or change
the landusage_data and waterareas_data entries in generate_style.py so that it queries the non-generalized
tables on the lower zoom levels (this will be slower for the lower zoom levels).

- the mapfiles are compatible with mapserver versions >= 6.0.

- documentation as to how to edit generate_style.py to adapt the rendering has yet to be done, but is simple.
